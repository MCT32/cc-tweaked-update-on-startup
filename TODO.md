# TODO
- [ ] Update files in config with github actions
- [ ] Make a version file so that the files only need to be updated if necessary
- [ ] Update version with github actions
- [ ] Periodic update checks and automatic rebooting in case of an update, configurable of course
- [ ] Potentially try using git to download files rather than github user content because it is slow to update
